A 2012 SIGCSE Special Projects Funding Request
===============================

Our work on [The Craft of Electronics](http://craftofelectronics.org/) aspires to be completely open. As a result, we will be producing materials in the open whenever possible.

This summer, we will be coming together to sprint on the design and development of materials for delivery in the fall of 2012. This proposal to the SIGCSE special projects fund requests travel support for one of our collaborators as well as monies to feed the small army that will be staying with Matt Jadud during nearly two months of the summer.
